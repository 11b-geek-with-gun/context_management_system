# FAQ
- **Whatâ€™s a YAML file?** A text file you edit like a document. Use Notepad or TextEdit.
- **How do I upload to AI?** Drag-and-drop or copy/paste into Grok/Claude.
- **Do I need a terminal?** No, AI provides copy/paste scripts or text instructions.
- **Why avoid editing YAML manually?** Small errors (like wrong spacing) can break files. Let the AI generate scripts to stay safe.
- **Why does my AI go off-topic?** ChatGPT may misread prompts. Use "start fresh" and say "setup CMS Framework." Claude may be better.
- **How do I know my system type?** Windows (PC), MacOS (Mac), Linux (e.g., Ubuntu). If unsure, say "none" for shell.
