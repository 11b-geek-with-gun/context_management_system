feedback: CMS Structure
date: 2025-04-24
permissions: 644  # Default
context: Day 0 CMS project
notes:
  - Jail analogy updated to chroot
  - Projects self-contained, no external references unless explicit
  - Root project file possible, but core data in isolated files
  - Proposed chroot structure:
    - personal: Previous personal projects
    - professional: Work tasks (e.g., school camera fixes, printer moves)
    - side-job: Future side gigs (not implemented)
    - military: Potential military projects (not implemented)
  - CMS as project: Chroot beneficial for dev, not overly restrictive
  - AI to be aware of nested systems (e.g., sub-chroots)
