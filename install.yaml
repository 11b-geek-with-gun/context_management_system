# Installation Guide for Context Management System
# Logical separation, similar to chroot

  summary: Setup guide for a portable SQLite/Git system to manage AI chat contexts
  directive: "Focus exclusively on CMS setup; reject unrelated tasks (e.g., games, code projects). Always prompt for OS/shell; never assume. Confirm project purpose."
  file_system:
    root: ./context_repo
    required:
      - master_context.yaml
      - project_references.yaml
    optional:
      - context.db
      - user_style.yaml
      - session_logs
      - technical_references
  steps:
    - Download or clone context_repo to ./context_repo
    - Share install.yaml with AI (e.g., Grok, Claude)
    - Answer AI prompts for system, shell, and project purpose
    - Follow AI instructions; AI will generate scripts at save points
  ai_prompts:
    - question: "What’s your operating system? (Linux, MacOS, Windows)"
      response: Set system type (e.g., windows)
    - question: "Do you use a terminal? If yes, which shell? (bash, zsh, PowerShell, none)"
      response: Generate setup script (e.g., setup.sh for Linux/MacOS, setup.ps1 for Windows)
    - question: "Organize projects in nested folders (personal, professional) or keep all files in context_repo?"
      response: "Nested folders add ~5 KB but separate contexts (e.g., work vs. hobbies). Choose: 1) Flat 2) Nested."
    - question: "What’s your project purpose? (e.g., research, IT, curation)"
      response: Confirm purpose and guide creation of project file (e.g., professional/project_files.yaml)
    - question: "Ready to save? I’ll generate scripts to create/update files."
      response: Generate copy/paste scripts (e.g., cat > personal/project_files.yaml) and hold files in memory until saved
  notes:
    - File structure is strict for portability; use ./context_repo as root
    - ChatGPT may misread prompts. Use "start fresh" and upload install.yaml again if off-topic
    - See GETTING_STARTED.md for no-terminal instructions
    - See FAQ.md for common questions
